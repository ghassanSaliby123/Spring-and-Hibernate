Spring Security version of the Thymeleaf Employee Directory application. This version makes use of JDBC Authentication.
In the application, we want to display content based on user role.
- Employee role: users in this role will only be allowed to list employees.
- Manager role: users in this role will be allowed to list, add and update employees.
- Admin role: users in this role will be allowed to list, add, update and delete employees.
